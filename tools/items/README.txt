# DuSI

Duduf System Information.
This is a script made for Adobe Applications.

It collects some system information which can be used when debugging scripts.
All collected information is saved to a text file, but it is NOT automatically sent to anyone.
You have to post this text file yourself with any bug report or when asked by a script developper.

This script can also be used to fix/uninstall other scripts developped by RxLaboratory or Duduf.

## How to use DuSI

Although DuSI can be installed permanently if you wish, by copying DuSI.jsx to an After Effects ScriptUI Panel for example,
if you just need to run it once, you can just use the "File/Scripts/Run Script" menu entry.
