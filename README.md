## What's this?

DuSI collects some system information which can be used when debugging scripts.
All collected information is saved to a text file, but it is NOT automatically sent to anyone.
You have to post this text file yourself with any bug report or when asked by a script developper.

This script can also be used to fix/uninstall other scripts developped by [@RxLaboratory](https://github.com/RxLaboratory) or [@Nico-Duduf](https://github.com/Nico-Duduf).
